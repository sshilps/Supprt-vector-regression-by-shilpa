 a basic project using Support Vector Regression (SVR) to predict salaries based on years of experience. SVR is a powerful machine learning algorithm that's particularly useful for regression tasks.
ðŸ“Š Data Import and Exploration:
Imported necessary libraries and loaded the dataset ('Position_Salaries.csv').
Explored the data to understand the structure of the features and target variable.
âœ¨ Data Preprocessing:
Reshaped the target variable to meet the requirements for SVR.
Applied Feature Scaling to standardize the input features using the StandardScaler from scikit-learn.
ðŸ§  Model Training:
Utilized the Support Vector Regression (SVR) algorithm with a radial basis function (RBF) kernel.
Trained the model on the entire dataset, creating a robust predictive model.
 
 
 ðŸ”® Prediction and Visualization:
Made predictions on a new data point to estimate the salary for a candidate with 6.5 years of experience.
Visualized the SVR results through a scatter plot and the predicted salary curve.
ðŸ“ˆ High-Resolution Visualization:
Enhanced the visualization with a higher resolution grid for a smoother curve, providing a more detailed view of the SVR predictions.
